# Muisckm Music Project

## Description
This is a web-based music application built with Tone.js, allowing for interactive playback of a custom music composition in the browser. It includes synths, sequences, and parts for a full musical experience.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or ensure you have the project files in your local directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies, including Tone.js and any other required packages.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Use the play, stop, and download buttons to control the music playback.
3. Note: Audio playback may require user interaction (e.g., clicking a button) due to browser autoplay policies.

## Dependencies
- Tone.js for audio synthesis and sequencing.
- Ensure you have a modern web browser that supports the Web Audio API.

## Troubleshooting
- If music doesn't play, check the browser console for errors (e.g., CORS issues with sample URLs).
- Make sure all scripts are loaded correctly in `index.html`.

## Credits
- Built using Tone.js library.
- Project maintained by mrbashyal.
